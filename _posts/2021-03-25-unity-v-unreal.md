title: 'Driving simulation: Unity or Unreal?'
layout: post
---
When it comes to game engines, the market is dominated by two giants: [Unity] and [Unreal]. It's worth mentioning that they're not the only actors in town, you can also find [Godot], [CRYENGINE], [Amazon Lumberyard], [UNIGINE], etc. But when it boils down to it, the question is: Unity or Unreal?

First of all, and to state the obvious, there's no single answer to that question. Both are amazing tools with a wide variety of features. So we'll focus on highlighting their differences, especially those most important when building a driving simulator.

# Who's using what?

One interesting thing to study is who's using what in the existing driving simulation world. Historically, everyone was either running their own engine or [OpenSceneGraph]. However, things are changing in the past few years, and even though historic actors aren't making a full move to new engines, they're at least integrating them in their solutions.

* [AVSimulation], [PreScan], [VI-grade], [CARLA] are using Unreal
* [Metamoto], [Cognata], [LGSVL] are using Unity
* [IPG] is using Unigine

If we look at the academic side, both [NADS] and [ITS Leeds] are using Unity. If we try to look for organisations that develop their in-house driving simulation platform (as we are), both [Scania][scania] and [WMG at the University of Warwick][wmg] are using Unreal.

# Target markets

This section might be more subjective, as it's difficult to find objective data on this subject. It's basically what I perceive from reading both engine's blogs and Twitter feeds.

Unity is undoubtedly the mobile market king, and seems to invest heavily in that. It's a bit more targeted towards small teams looking to make small to mid-range games. Even though it's widening its target market beyond games, this move somehow feels a bit late.

Unreal has made a strong move to various industry sectors in the past years: automotive, arch-viz, military and lately virtual production. Even though games still are at their core, they're serious about every market expansion they make. Their [Build][build] event, [Automotive Field Guide][afg], or just the fact that their [Industry Manager][sloze] is active on Twitter are great signs of their commitment.

# Programming languages

One of the main difference between Unity and Unreal is their programming language. Unity uses C# (and now [Bolt][bolt]), whereas Unreal uses C++ and [Blueprints][bp].

The C# vs. C++ debate is a whole other topic that I'll gloss over. Let's just say that C# certainly is an easier language to get into. C++ might have a very slight performance edge, though it's narrowing. For us, one important factor was that we had quite a few libraries with C++ classes, so working in a C++ environment makes our life easier by not having to interface our C++ classes to C#.

[![uebp.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/uebp.png)][1]

On the visual programming subject, I was heavily conflicted. On the one side, it's easy to use, especially for some researchers that may not be too keen on writing code. On the other side, well, [there's a lot of other sides][vpbad]. Versioning can be difficult, [spaghetti code][spaghet] can take a very literal [meaning][hell], etc.

# CAVE rendering

Rendering the scene on a 360Â° screen comes with a specific set of challenges. Unless you're doing desktop or VR-headset experiments, you'll probably have to face those. Unity and Unreal both have very different ways of handling those problematics. 
 
[![CAVE](/images/360sim.jpg)][2]

Unity is a bit messy on this subject. Historically, it had a feature called [Cluster Rendering][cluster], which answered this problematic, but this features kind of disappeared, leaving many users wondering [what to use instead][unity-ndisp]. A replacement was announced for 2019, then 2020, and as I'm writing this in 2021, there's no official word from Unity.

So in the meantime, external solutions were introduced. [MiddleVR][middlevr] is the leading one, though the price might not be suitable for everyone. Then there's [UniCAVE][unicave], which is open-source, but from what I've heard, requires some extra work to get it compatible with Unity's latest releases. Another one is [VR Distrib][vrdistrib], which I have no feedback on.

Unreal is straightforward with its answer to the problem: [nDisplay]. This solution is used across different application cases: simulation, virtual production, etc. The feature is well supported, with constant improvements since a big refactor in the 4.22 release.

# Miscellaneous

Unity has a stronger foothold in education curriculum, meaning the available workforce is probably higher for Unity developers. Unity also has a more furnished [Asset Store] than Unreal's [Marketplace], though you'll probably find anything you want for your driving simulation in both.

If you regularly browse [Hacker News], it's not uncommon to have people complaining about Unity. Here's a [recent example][garry], which was also discussed on Reddit ([r/gamedev], [r/Unity3D]). Even if Unreal Engine obviously has its pitfalls, it's always interesting to read these discussions to get feedback from others users.

[![ue5.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ue5.jpg)][Unreal Engine 5]

Unreal seems on the forefront of innovation, with [Unreal Engine 5], [MetaHuman Creator] or [realtime ray-tracing][RTX]. However, Unity is not left behind, its [Data-Oriented Technology Stack][dots] sure is a nice addition to the tool, for which Unreal has no equivalent (yet?).

# Conclusion

So, what do you choose? Well, we chose Unreal. The main deciding factors were [nDisplay] and the easier integration of our existing C++ libs. Looking back, I still think we've made the right decision. But it absolutely doesn't mean that Unity is not a valid choice for making a driving simulator. As mentioned, a lot of organisations have chosen it and seem quite happy with it. So the decision is yours to make, based on your specificities and requirements.
