Things are pretty slow over here, so it's going to be a short one.

# Unreal news

Epic announced Unreal Engine's [new pricing model](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/we-are-updating-unreal-engine-twinmotion-and-realitycapture-pricing-in-late-april), which is a rather common seat-based system. The new [EULA](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/eula/unreal) detailing all that is also out, and I was very glad to find the "*Non-commercial exception*", which covers (most of) our uses of the engine. So no big change for us.

This change coincides with the [5.4 release](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available). We've got a 5.4 branch of our project, though we have to wait for some third party dependencies updates before moving projects over (e.g., Varjo). Small internal milestone: with the release, I officially moved our `master` branch from 4.27 to 5.3, so I guess our Unreal Engine 4 days are now officially over! Well, kind of, we still have a 4.27 experiment running soon, so...

Unrelated: Epic [publishes lot of learning resources](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/unreal-engine/learning?source=epic_games&sort_by=first_published_at) on the [Epic Dev Community](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/unreal-engine), but sadly they're not really well advertised. I bookmarked the page and regularly check for new interesting content, and I encourage you to do the same!

# Research projects

## [NEWMOB](/whats-new-2024-02/#newmob)

We're deep into the development of the scooter-riding part of this project.

On the software side of things, we're working on multiple scenarios each with a few complex situations. This is more or less following the [same workflow](https://vhcd.github.io/workflow-1/) as described before, so at this point we're getting pretty good at this. But we decided to also include some [Glow Path](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/glow-path-light-trail-spline) to help guide the riders, which is a lot of fun to work with.

On the hardware side, we're in the process setting up the simulator, so that includes the actual scooter, the [Buttkicker](https://vhcd.github.io/buttkicker/), the Varjo XR-3 and all the Mixed Reality configuration, the sound system, [StreamDecks](https://vhcd.github.io/streamdeck/) and all of the safety features to ensure everything goes well once the experiment starts.

## [PrÃ©vision](/whats-new-2024-02/#prÃ©vision)

What's new on this project? Well, that's a good question. I'll go find out and get back to you on that later ðŸ˜›

## BERTHA

New project alert! And it's a big one. [BERTHA](https://berthaproject.eu/) is a Horizon Europe project, which also includes [CARLA](https://carla.org/) among its partners. We'll work to develop a Driver Behavioural Model, and obviously that will involve Unreal things. People have already joined our team for this project, so expect more in the future!

# Motion Capture

For (yet another) project, I needed a scooter rider fall animation. And believe me: there's not a single one on the [Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store). 

However, I remembered that one of my labs ([LBMC](https://lbmc.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/)) ran an experiment a few months back to compare traditional and markerless motion capture system. What does this have to do with falling scooter you might ask? Well, the motion being captured for that experiment was just that: falling scooters.

So a colleague was kind enough to export an animation for the [Qualisys](https://www.qualisys.com/) tool, which I then cleaned up in Blender, imported in Unreal and retargeted on Epic skeleton.

</video>

The end result is... okay I guess, but since then Epic added [Auto Retargeting](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/GpL9/unreal-engine-fortnite-auto-retargeting-for-bipeds) (which includes Qualisys skeleton), so I'm guessing it's even easier now.

I could probably make this a lot better using the new [Physics Control component](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK7FBBdY5fY), but hey, that would require me being motivated to do that, so... I guess I'll do that, but later.

# Marketplace

[CityBLD](https://www.worldbld.com/) is out! I didn't really have the opportunity to work with it yet, but it looks very promising. Lots of features and kits coming.

[Reallusion](https://www.reallusion.com/) released [BuildingGen](https://www.reallusion.com/iclone/building-gen/), which is... weird, given that they specializes on character tools. But the tool looks very interesting nonetheless, especially since they have a [French Style pack](https://www.reallusion.com/ContentStore/iClone/pack/building-gen/3d-building-french-style/), which is perfect for us.

Speaking of french things, check out this [signs pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/roadsign-bp) on the Marketplace, which also includes direction signs. At this point we've got so much european style assets
