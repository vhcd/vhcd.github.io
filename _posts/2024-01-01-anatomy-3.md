In our [latest update](/whats-new-2023-11/), I briefly introduced a new project we've been working on: [Sérénité](/whats-new-2023-11/#sérénité). In this post, we'll dive deeper into the making of the scenario for this experiment, and how Unreal makes everything awesome.

# Requirements

For this experiment, the requirements for the driving simulation side of things were fairly explicit and easy to understand.
* Fully autonomous scenario (no user input required)
* 3-lane highway
* Start and finish at a rest stop
* During this highway ride, we'll encounter
  * A fixed amount of cars `C`
  * On any lane (opposite or same direction)
  * For cars on our side, we should overtake some, and others should overtake us
  * `X`% of cars should be white, the others being colored
  * White cars should appear at time interval between `T1` and `T2`
    * Strict interval
    * Totality of spawn time intervals should average to the specified range's mean

Twist: we'll actually need two of those, one with a `D1` min duration, the other `D2` min (the amount of cars `C` being adjusted accordingly between the two).

# Scene

For the scene we'll need two things: a highway, and one or more rest stops. For the highway itself, we'll go with a ring, because we can drive endlessly on it (well, at least until the participant realises they're just going round and round).

## Highway ring

For another earlier and unrelated project[RoadRunner](https://www.mathworks.com/products/roadrunner.html), I had made a somewhat okay highway ring using [RoadRunner](https://www.mathworks.com/products/roadrunner.html), which actually never ended up being used.

From what I recall, I just drew a ring on RoadRunner and added some elevation and curves to make it less boring. Then I imported it in Unreal, added a [Landscape](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/landscape-quick-start-guide-in-unreal-engine/), applied [my favorite auto-material](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/landscape-smart-material) on it and [auto-sculpted it](https://github.com/brifsttar/OpenDRIVE#landscape-sculpting) based on OpenDRIVE data. And that was pretty much it.

Since this scene had now moved up from "prototype" to "actually used", I had to go back to RoadRunner to ensure that curves followed the rules of French highway: if possible, curvature radius should stay above 2000m, and should never go below 800m. Rules which apparently are very much *not* the defaults in RoadRunner.

## Rest stop

Now that we had a nice ring, we needed a rest stop. Do you know what the road geometry of a highway rest stop actually look like? I certainly didn't. But thanks to our overlord over in the Silicon Valley, Google Earth and Street View both exist.

So I used a random rest stop from around my childhood home as reference, and just went about creating something similar in RoadRunner. Which, thanks to RoadRunner's amazing tools, didn't take much time.

Then I imported that in Unreal, did a bit of back and forth between the tools to fine tune some things (mostly lane markings). In Unreal, I added some props and foliage and that was it!

Shout out to [Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace) creator [Der Sky](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Der+Sky), whose "[European Collection: French Highway](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/european-collection-french-highway)" product is absolutely perfect for this use case. Go check their products, if you need road props and signs, they most likely have what you want.

# Scenario

## Design choices

The scenario was the really interesting part of this project. From the requirements, it might look like a boring scenario (it was designed that way for experimental purposes), but let's have some fun with this!

### Hand-crafted

One very un-fun way of implementing the scenario would be to do it by hand. Meaning, hand placing every one of the `C` vehicle on the road, giving each of their speed and other goals, ensuring that the placement follows the various requirements.

This would work. It would also probably be the fastest way. But also the most boring one, and most importantly, the least flexible. What if we decide to change the car count? Or the timing between them? That would lead to a lot more work down the line.

### Procedural

Another approach would be to procedurally generate the scenario based on the actual requirements. After all, it doesn't seem to be that hard to translate those to code, and exposing the variables for the researchers to play with. That way, if they decide to change the timings, duration or car colors, it would take a simple button press to generate a new scenario.

Yes, but... A procedural scenario is tricky to get right. You have to ensure you don't get into some weird situations, like cars getting too close to one another. And it's also harder to fine tune: if the researcher say they like this iteration of the procedural scenario, except for *this car at 3min42s that's a bit too fast*, you can't easily just change that without changing everything.

### Why don't we have (a bit of) both?

![](/images/why_not_both.png#center)

Why indeed. It would be great to have both the control and fine-tuning of the hand-crafted method, all the while having the high-level and heavily automated features of the procedural way. And the answer to that is...

## Data Table

[Data Tables](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/data-driven-gameplay-elements-in-unreal-engine/) are great. They're basically CSV files. Or Excel spreadsheet if that's your thing.

And we can think of our scenario as a spreadsheet! Each row would be a car to spawn. And for columns, we'd have the time at which it should spawn, its color, its lane, etc.

Working with this "intermediate" format gives us the best of both world: if we want to go the "hand-crafted" way, we can just write it ourself. If we want to go the "procedural" way, we can just ask our friend Python to do it for us.

And if we want a bit of both: we procedurally generate a "reference" scenario, which we then fine-tune based on testing and feedback. Which is exactly what I did.

Above is the actual scenario we used for this experiment. It was first generated by a Python script that took as input the experiment variables (e.g., car count, time range between spawn). Then, I fed that file to a very simple "scenario player" that I wrote (in Blueprints), and just played it. Obviously some lines needed tweaking, to avoid visible spawns in some locations, or to give a more "realistic" feeling to some behaviors.

## Debug display

Debugging and fine tuning of this "spreadsheet" scenario can be difficult. Because when I'm just [Playing In Editor](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/playing-and-simulating-in-unreal-engine/) and after a while I see a car going a bit too fast for my taste, how do I match it back to the correct row in my Data Table?

</video>

I chose one of the most overkill solution: I created a runtime text-to-billboard(/sprite) component, that is attached to each car as they spawn. That way, when researchers and I are discussing some car behavior that needs adjusting, there's no doubt which line of the CSV needs to be tuned!
