title: Unreal Marketplace products for Driving Simulation
---
For us, one of the major benefit of using Unreal Engine is its [Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store). It offers the ability to purchase so many products, at very reasonable prices, and that work out-of-the-box. It saved us countless amount of time and money, compared to our previous workflows. However, finding the right products for your needs is not always easy, so I thought I'd share the list of product we own, our favorites, and some comments on them.

Note before we start: I recently wrote a [small script](https://github.com/brifsttar/UnrealMarketplaceVaultExtractor) to extract the content of one's  [Vault](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/vault), which is what led to this article.

This article gets updated regularly as our Vault grows. New items get tagged so it's easier to keep track of.

* *[22-08]* is for the August 2022 update

# Creators to follow

Before getting into the actual (long) list of items, I'd first like to mention a few Marketplace creators who make great products, perfect for driving or overall immersive simulation, and for which I'm always eagerly waiting their next creation.

* [Der Sky](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Der+Sky)

If you want road signs or road props, look no further: Der Sky has everything you need. Quality, content, low prices; it's hard not to buy everything.

* [lyoshko](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/lyoshko)

Not only does lyoshko create the best cars in the whole Marketplace, they also have a wide variety of products that are really useful, and which I often didn't know I needed until I saw them.

* [PolySphere Studio](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/PolySphere+Studio)

PolySphere is pretty much the reference for procedural buildings. High quality, high performance, heavily customizable, complete documentation, amazing support. I only wished they had more european buildings, but I recommend them nonetheless.

* [Meik.W Models](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Meik.W+Models)

Meik.W's product aren't the best looking you'll find on the Marketplace, but they cover a wide range of scene elements needed for driving simulation. They're optimized, cheap and varied, and that's fine by me.

# "Must have" products

First of all, let's go over the *must have* Marketplace products for driving simulation. They mostly cover the basics: vehicles, buildings, props, actors. Once you have all that, you're already most of the way.

## Free

The Marketplace is full of free stuff, and maybe surprinsigly, most of it is very high-quality. By spending literally no money, you can already go quite far.

* [Advanced Locomotion System V4](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/advanced-locomotion-system-v1)

Referred as ALS in the community, this Blueprint is super useful if you want to have pedestrians walking around your scene. No need to handle animations, layering or blendspaces, ALS does all that for you.

* [Scanned 3D People Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/9c3fab270dfe468a9a920da0c10fa2ad)

This is a freebie pack from [RenderPeople](https://renderpeople.com/). I tried it, and immediatly decided that from then on, I wouldn't ever worry about creating human models; I now just buy them from RenderPeople, but this free pack is a great way to get started.

* [City Park Environment Collection](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/city-park-environment-collection)
* [Downtown West Modular Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/6bb93c7515e148a1a0a0ec263db67d5b)
* [Factory Environment Collection](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/factory-environment-collection)
* [Rural Australia](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/rural-australia)

Those environments are just amazing. You get high quality environments to explore and learn from; assets to reuse and kitbash.

* [Twinmotion Posed Humans 1](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/twinmotion-posed-humans)
* [Twinmotion Construction Vehicles 1](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/twinmotion-construction-vehicles)
* [Twinmotion Posed Humans Shopping Pack 1](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/twinmotion-posed-humans-shopping-pack-1) *[22-08]*
* [Twinmotion Posed Humans Winter Pack 1](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/twinmotion-posed-humans-winter-pack-1) *[22-08]*
* [Twinmotion Entertainment Pack 1](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/twinmotion-entertainment-pack-1) *[22-08]*
* [Twinmotion Posed Humans Children Pack 1](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/twinmotion-posed-humans-children-pack-1) *[22-08]*

Epic is bringing over content from [TwinMotion](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/twinmotion), and I can't wait to see what's next, because those two are just perfect for us.

* [City Sample Crowds](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/city-sample-crowds) *[22-08]*
* [City Sample Buildings](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/city-sample-buildings) *[22-08]*
* [City Sample Vehicles](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/city-sample-vehicles) *[22-08]*
* [City Sample](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/city-sample) *[22-08]*

The CitySample is Epic's internal name for [The Matrix Awakens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU0gvPcc3jQ), which is not only a mind-blowing demo, but also available for free on the Marketplace. Since it's huge (100GB), there are also dedicated products for buildings, vehicles and crowds; which is just perfect for our use case.

* [Megascans Trees: European Black Alder (early access)](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/megascans-trees-european-black-alder-early-access) *[22-08]*

Want some trees? [Quixel](https://quixel.com/) has you covered.

* [Landscape Pro 2.0 Auto-Generated Material](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/landscape-pro-auto-generated-material)

I didn't play that much with this Landscape Material (I bought one before this one was free), but from what I saw, it's just a perfect way to get started to use [Landscape](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/BuildingWorlds/Landscape/Creation/) on your scene. Use it, and you won't ever need to worry about creating a forest anymore, the Material will take care of it for you.

* [Procedural Building Generator](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/procedural-building-generator)
* [Vehicle Variety Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/bbcb90a03f844edbb20c8b89ee16ea32)
* [Vehicle Variety Pack Volume 2](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/9a705589d1994c6e8757fdbedaf698af) *[22-08]*

Building and vehicles. I'm not a huge fan of either of those, but hey, it's free, so I'm not complaining.

* [TCP Socket Plugin](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/tcp-socket-plugin)

Because we all need to send TCP messages at some point.

* [Linter v2](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/linter-v2)

Because every language needs a [style guide](https://github.com/Allar/ue5-style-guide), Blueprint is no exception. This linter makes sure that you follow the rules!

## Vehicles & actors

Want to add moving things? Here are a few.

* [7 Cars Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/7-cars-pack)
* [Velocity Cars Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/velocity-cars-pack) *[22-08]*

By far and large my favorite car packs, I pretty much only use those for moving vehicles. Both from the same creator.

* [Truck and Trailers](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/truck-and-trailers)
* [Bus](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/bus)

Both by the same creator ([VMR](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/VMR)), those vehicles are great if you want to have *not just cars* in your world.

* [Citizen NPC](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/citizen-npc)

When we need to populate our scene with random people, we just use one from this. They're modular, so pretty much infinite combinations can be done.

## Scene

To build a realistic driving scenario, you need a realistic scene. That includes various types of buildings (residential, commercial, factories, etc.) and props.

### Buildings

* [Suburbs](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/suburbs)

### Misc

## Tools

* [NV Spline Tools](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/nv-spline-tools)

There are quite a few spline mesh tools on the Marketplace, but this is the one we use, and we love it. Speeds up scene creation.

# Useful
